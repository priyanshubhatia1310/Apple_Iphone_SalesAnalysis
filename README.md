"In a world of chaos, Tableau brings clarity through visualization."

📊 Just finished creating dashboard with Tableau.

 👀 Visualization based on - Apple Product Sales in India.
 The sales of Apple products in India are displayed on this dashboard.It contains information on the sales price, MRP, and discount in addition to ratings and reviews.

Dashboard Summary:-
 1. The product and MRP are displayed in the first bar chart.
 2. The second graph establishes a correlation between the number of ratings and the discount percentage using a scatter plot.
 3. The top 10 highly rated Apple items are displayed in the third chart.
 4. The fourth chart shows the MSRP of Apple goods based on RAM capacity.
